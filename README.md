## 📝 Project Description
PixelStore is a fully functional, dynamic e-commerce web application designed for purchasing digital video games. The platform features a modern, neon-themed "Cyberpunk" aesthetic with glassmorphism effects and smooth interactive animations.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a full-stack web development implementation using PHP and MySQL without relying on external frameworks. It simulates a real-world shopping experience where users can browse a catalog, filter games by category, manage a shopping cart, and securely checkout.

**Key Features:**
Dynamic Catalog: Fetches games from a MySQL database with support for categories (Action, RPG, Racing, etc.).

User Authentication: Secure Login and Registration system with password hashing.

Shopping Cart System: Users can add/remove items and view a real-time total summary.

Checkout Process: Includes input masking for credit cards (MM/YY date formatting, CVV validation) and order processing.

Admin Panel: A dedicated dashboard for administrators to add, delete, and manage game inventory.

Interactive UI: Features staggered "wave" animations on scroll, 3D hover effects, and auto-hiding alerts.

Responsive Design: Fully optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
